NAME stooped to VERB1 it; he did VERB1 it; but the ADJECTIVE turn VERBd him round the neck, and voicelessly as ADJECTIVE mutes bowstring their NOUN, he was shot out of the NOUN, ere the crew VERBd he was gone. Next instant, the ADJECTIVE eye-splice in the rope's final NOUN flew out of the stark-empty tub, knocked down NAME, and smiting the sea, VERBd in its depths.
